# 🪨📄✂️ Rock-Paper-Scissors Mini-Game in Python

A simple and interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using Python for the command line.

## 🎯 Project Objective

This project was created to practice and demonstrate:
- Python basics
- Conditional logic
- Looping structures
- User input validation
- Random number generation
- Clean code structuring

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `random` – for generating the computer’s move
- `re` – for validating user input with Regular Expressions
- `os` – for system-level operations *(optional use)*

## 🔍 Features

- Continuous gameplay in a loop
- Input validation with regex
- Random move generation for the computer
- Proper game logic handling (Win/Lose/Tie)
- Exit option to end the game gracefully

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
